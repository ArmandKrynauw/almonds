# Hybrid Learning in Neural Networks for Almond Classification 

## Introduction

This is a University project that looks into exploring hybrid learning techniques in
neural networks for almond classification.

## How to run this project?

### Install the required packages

Install the required packages and create a virtual environment by running the
following command if you have [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed:

```bash
uv venv
```

If you don't have `uv` installed, you can create a virtual environment by running:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Then, install the required packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Jupyter Notebook

Open the Jupyter Notebook, select the correct interpreter, and run the cells to
see the results.
